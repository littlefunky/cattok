## What is this

`CatTok` is where you can find and share video about cats.

## Why ?

Developers love cat ðŸ˜º (at least us), So we created this web app just for educational and for fun.

## How it was made

We choose MERN stack ðŸ’», cuz we love how simplicity and developer experience it gave us.

We separate logic to 2 part which live within separated folder at root

- \_frontend - UI made with React
- \_backend - API Backend
